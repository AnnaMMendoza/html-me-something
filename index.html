        <h3>A Frustrating Bag Situation</h3>

          <p>This trip to Miami would only be my second flight on an airplane ever. I really hadn't been thinking anything about it at all. All was well with me and flying again. I had borrowed a bag and was all packed and thought about all the things I would need during the trip. So no big deal at all to me. Until I arrived I was guessing, that is the way it always is, right?</p>

          <p>We arrived at the airport a little later than expected and so we weren't really rushing. But we didn't know we needed to be rushing yet. Back and forth to different lines that appeared to be where we should have been, but as we found out, they were not the right lines for us to be in. And to check in my bag, was a different line of course. We get it checked in and then have to deliver it ourselves to the checked baggage line! Really? I swore they took my luggage here at the counter on my first flight out of KC. But I was informed I was 45 minutes late, which I heard as 5 minutes late, so I wasn't worried about my luggage not making it onto the plane. It was only 5 minutes anyway. And we were not on the plane yet ourselves.</p>

          <p>So again we go into another wrong line only to be turned away to another line much further away. This whole time no one is looking at the time. We did not know how close we were to not boarding the plane! We finally found the right line and then had to do the take all the stuff out of your pockets and place into the bins thing. I'm slow as it is, so can you imagine being behind me in that line? Yes, I'm pretty slow. I never took out my mobile charger which stayed in my laptop bag and wasn't flagged or searched that I saw. The next time, I did remove it from my bag. But this first time, no one caught it, or they knew what it was? Not sure what to think about that one.</p>

          <p>We barely left that line and got ourselves together again before we hear the announcement that our flight has been fully boarded! And we were not on it yet! So then we start running (for me quickly shuffling) to the bridge to our flight! We made it, even though one of us had been picked out to be more thoroughly searched, why? Who knows but it took longer than we thought. But they came not far behind us while we waited on the bridge. Moving towards the plane but meandering enough to see when they would make it behind us. Off to Miami! Our flight was pretty packed, so we found seats at the back end of the plane. Also, we were on the side where the baggage comes off the plane so I was able to see if mine made it on the plane. And it didn't, as we watched them unload the luggage! Hopefully, it would be at the next one once we reached Miami.</p>

          <p>Since my bag wasn't unloaded on the layover airport (but it did make it to Miami with us) I was wondering what to do about finding it, so, I ran around trying to find the Customer Service Baggage Office and asked them about it first. The lady there told me to check the carousel for it first to make sure it did not arrive. Which I hadn't thought of at all. So I walked back to the baggage area and saw it going around on the carousel out of my reach. I watched it as it went back into the baggage area on the belt. I was not sure that it would show up again, so I asked those around me and they confirmed yes, it would. Phew! So I waited for it and snagged it up when it came back around. Now, our visit can begin!</p>

        <h3>While in Miami...</h3>

          <p>One of the first things we did was visit the <a href="https://www.gatorpark.com/">Gator Park</a> in the Miami Everglades. We did see one alligator in the waters there that swam directly at the boat until we stopped to take pictures. Then he sat there floating in the water just watching us.</p>

          <p>Another thing we did was a boat tour of the rich and famous homes and it was in the evening so the Miami skyline lit up for the second half of the tour and it was so amazing! This was <a href="http://fiestacruises.com/?page_id=38">Captain Jimmy's Fiesta Cruises</a> whose tour we took.</p>

          <p>And of course we went to South Beach! One of the beaches that has not closed due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tide">"Red Tide"</a>! We stayed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Florida">Hollywood</a> area, which is North of Miami, Florida. They closed the beaches the next day or so after we arrived there due to "Red Tide", and my sister and her boyfriend actually experienced that discomfort on one of those beaches on our second day. But the fencing around the beach reminded me of the movie Jaws!</p>

          <p>I enjoyed the buildings and the business of Ocean Drive too! Someone said this looks like a scene from the movie "Scarface"</p>

          <p>And this has quickly become the favorite restaurant to have dinner near South Beach.</p>

  	<h3>Then on the way back home...</h3>

      <p>On the way back home, we were early for our flight, so I checked my bag in plenty of time before the flight. I was the first one to check my bag (I think) in our party of 6. So when my bag never made it back to Kansas City, I was pretty shocked! Of course they don't know why or what happened and they informed me they would have to have a delivery service bring it directly to my home. So that was conveneient. But as far as that and the comfort items (food and coffee) I tried to have to appease my discomfort for all that was happening, none of that went well either...but the trip was great fun!</p>

      <p>It turns out we left Florida before Hurricane Michael took over (not sure if our flight would have been delayed or not, but I am thinking it would have!) and arrived back in Kansas City, MO after the torrential rains had ended too! I would say we are pretty lucky! I would do it again! The frustration was real, and the rushing was tough on me, but it was better than staying at home!</p>
